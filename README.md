Here is a readme file.  I guess github likes these -- I will update it later.

This files contains my customization files for *nix systems (macbooks and linux servers).

I should also take the time to describe my computing environment, which uses lots of terminals, lots of emacs, and vnc/fluxbox on my developmant machines


Terminals/Shells:
ZSH: I use zsh, instead of bash, which lets me use escape sequences to talk to my screen sessions
GNU Screen: this lets me work on remote machines

Desktop:
Fluxbox@Work, MacOSX@Home/Laptop

Computers:
Macbook Pro, Macbook Air, Linux Machines, Datacenters

Q: does emacs git let me push it?
