This repository contains my dotfiles/customization-files for ***nix** systems (macbooks and linux servers).

I should also take the time to describe my computing environment, which uses lots of terminals, lots of emacs, and vnc/fluxbox on my developmant machines

To install these scripts do the following
``` sh
git clone git@github.com:quantombone/linux-jedi-files.git
cd ~/linux-jedi-files/
./make_alias_script.sh
```

## Core *nix programs:
 * ZSH: I use zsh, instead of bash, which lets me use escape sequences to talk to my screen sessions.
 * GNU Screen: this lets me work on remote machines, and is useful for spawning remote jobs on a cluster.
 * Emacs: I am a hardcore emacs nerd. I can't even tell you all the keybindings which my fingers have memorized, but damn I'm fast. (see my .emacs file)

## Desktop:
Fluxbox@Work, MacOSX@Home/Laptop

## Types of computers I use my linux-jedi-files on:
Macbook Pro, Macbook Air, iMac, Linux Machines, Datacenters

## Note for Apple Machines
It is a good idea to get MacPorts and "sudo port install ..." a bunch of core utilities
