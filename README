Here is a readme file.  I guess github likes these -- I will update it later.

This files contains my customization files for *nix systems (macbooks and linux servers).

I should also take the time to describe my computing environment, which uses lots of terminals, lots of emacs, and vnc/fluxbox on my developmant machines
